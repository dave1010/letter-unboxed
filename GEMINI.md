Letter Unboxed

TypeScript project.

See README.md for dev info.
See ROADMAP.md for tasks and context. Keep status up to date.

Take a pragmatic TDD approach.

## Definition of Done

- `npm run lint` passes
- `npm run test` passes
- Code has been refsctored to keep tech debt low
- Tests are comprehensive
- Functionality works (automated tests or user confirmation if it can't be automated
- All docs are up to date

If any of these are not done then the task is not complete.

## Git

Be considerate when staging paths. Don't do `git add .`!
